# Biography

Hello! I'm a Los Angeles based Data Scientist currently working at Warner Bros. Entertainment, where I leverage my R, Python, SQL, and Machine Learning skills to develop end-to-end data science solutions to many of the challenging problems faced by the studio.

I have a proven track record of delivering data-driven business solutions in the areas of theatrical marketing, theatrical distribution, box office modeling and forecasting, A/B test design and analysis, and content insight, among others.

If you have a project you think I could tackle, please reach out to me at [meadectm@gmail.com](mailto:meadectm@gmail.com).
